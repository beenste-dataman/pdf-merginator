The PDF Merger is a Python script that allows you to easily combine multiple PDF files into a single, merged PDF document. It uses the `PyPDF2` library to perform the merging process efficiently. The tool offers flexibility by letting you merge any number of PDF files, not limited to just three. Follow the instructions below to use the PDF Merger and create your consolidated PDF:

**1. Running the Script:**
Save the provided Python script in a file, for example, `pdf_merger.py`. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and execute the following command:


python pdf_merger.py


The PDF Merger will now start running, and you will be presented with a stylish title using ASCII art, followed by detailed instructions.

**2. Inputting PDF Files:**
The script will prompt you to enter the total number of PDF files you want to merge. Type the number and press `Enter`. Next, you will be asked to provide the full paths of each PDF file one by one. Input the paths correctly, and the script will remember the order you provide for merging.

**3. Choosing Output Filename:**
After entering all the PDF file paths, the script will prompt you to choose an output filename for the merged PDF. Type the desired name and press `Enter`.

**4. Merging PDFs:**
The PDF Merger will now combine the specified PDF files based on your input order. It will create a new PDF file containing the content of all the input PDFs. The merged PDF will be saved in the same directory as the script, using the output filename you provided.

**5. Confirmation and Completion:**
Once the merging process is complete, the script will display a confirmation message with the output filename. You can now find the merged PDF in the same directory as the script, ready for use.

That's it! The PDF Merger tool offers a simple and effective way to merge your PDF documents without the need for third-party software. Enjoy consolidating your PDF files hassle-free!
